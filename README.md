# Machine Learning And Deep Learning And NLP Projects
1)Bank Customer Risk Analysis: 
This is an ML project which analyzes the data of bank customers and their behaviour, characteristics and transations and will predict whether the customer is going to leave the bank or not.This type of projects are used for bank furthur studies and helps in implementation of new programs

2)Basket Analysis Using Apriori:
In this project their will be items in basket in supermarket by using Apriori we'll draw out frequently brought itemsets and patterns using minimum support and confidence and lift and create frequent item sets to ensure shopkeepers make a use of it.

3)Conversion Data of Customers (AdaBoost):
Predicting the people that are converted to our product with the factors like place they live, age, how they got to know about us, this can be used by many companies around to analyse the behaviour or response of the customers towards their product

4)Cancer Prediction :
This is the projects the predicts whether cancer is present or not in the patients by studying and trained the previous confiremed cases of cancer data and was done using Random Forest Classfier

5)GOT Character Alive prediction :
By using Support Vector Machine Algorithm here we analyze and predict the live status (dead or alive) by studying the characteristics of characters in GOT TV show.

6)CryptoCurrencyValue Future Prediction :
Here we take the data of  crypto currency value in market date wise from its start and predict the future of the value of the same by using ML algorithms

7)Employee promotion prediction :
Here we analyze the data of employees in the company and using Decision tree classifier we predict whether the employee will be promoted or not

8)Gas Prices and Fifa Data Analysation :
This is analysation of data by drawing out few cool facts from the given data using graphs and basically matplotlib library usage

9)Heart attack prediction :
ML project that studies many health factors regarding heart and predicts whether the person is likely to get a heart attack or not.

10)Conversion Data of Customers (Logistic Regression) :
Predicting the people that are converted to our product with the factors like place they live, age, how they got to know about us, this can be used by many companies around to analyse the behaviour or response of the customers towards their product and also a sample program o how Logistic regresssion works

11)London Crime Prone Area Analysis :
Here we analyze the London crome rate in many areas of London and predict the highly crime prone areas using ML algorithms

12)Sentimental Analyzer into 7 different Emotions :
-->Using NLP and no machine learning algorithm it sstudies the tweets and reviews on some product or any tag and then predicts the sentiment of the part into 7 emotions (Joy, Sadness, Shame, Guilt,
